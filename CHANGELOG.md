## Version 3.0

### Stability Update

April 10th, 2023

This update focuses on improving stability, reliability, and usability.

- Improved aircraft alert processing.
    - The ADS-B intake process is now automatic, and is managed by Assassin.
    - Aircraft with no location data are now filtered from the alert display.
    - Improved the resiliency of the data intake process.
    - Fixed an issue where the message intake file could grow exponentially.
    - Renamed the "Planes" display to "Aircraft".
- Improved drone alert process.
    - The wireless threat database can now contain full MAC addresses to identify individual devices.
    - The drone detection process now considers all Airodump-NG output files, not just the first.
    - Automatic start-up mode is not significantly more reliable.
- Improved the Bluetooth alert process.
    - Bluetooth scanning is now done on a separate thread to prevent Assassin from freezing during scanning.
    - There is now a dedicated Bluetooth display in the main information display that shows the number of Bluetooth devices currently detected.
    - Added alert latch time configuration value to prevent alerts from being displayed until Assassin restarts after they are triggered.
- Improved GPS alert process.
    - The GPS alert configuration section has been re-organized for sake of clarity.
    - GPS no-data alerts can now be configured the require multiple sequential instances of no GPS data being returned before an alert is triggered.
    - Improved overspeed alerts.
        - GPS alerts overspeed alerts are no longer triggered when no GPS data is received.
        - Overspeed alerts can now be configured to prioritize the highest speed alert when multiple alerts are triggered at once.
    - Added support for frozen GPS alerts, where alerts can be triggered when exactly identical GPS data is received repeatedly.
    - GPS alerts are now detected in chronological order, such that the process looks through the location history in order from oldest to most recent.
    - Alert types in the GPS alert display are now capitalized.
- Modified the loading process for ALPR camera and traffic cameras.
    - ALPR cameras now load based on the current location.
        - The loaded radius can be set in the configuration.

## Version 3.1

April 19th, 2023

- Fixed a bug that would cause a hard crash when drone threat logging was disabled.
- Improved the stability of the drone data parsing process.


## Version 4.0

### Name Pending

*Release date to be determined*

- Added Predator ALPR integration.
    - Assassin can now be configured to display alerts from Predator.
- Added support for OBD integration.
    - Using an ELM327 adapter, Assassin can monitor ground speed, engine revolutions per minute, fuel tank level, and airflow rate, and trigger alerts when certain thresholds are broken.
- Refined the POI database format.
    - The ALPR camera database has been updated to reflect these changes, and includes additional refinements as well.
- Refined the configuration loading process.
    - Functions related to configuration loading and validation have been moved to a dedicated script, titled `config,py`
    - The configuration is now validated at startup based on an outline template.
- Added support for GPS diagnostic alerts, which simply issue an alert containing the most recent GPS information.
- Created a dedicated working directory configuration value.
    - Removed the telemetry directory configuration value.
    - Renamed the `general > adsb_alerts > adsb_message_file` configuration value to `adsb_message_filename`, which is now only a file name that is saved to the dedicated working directory.
- Moved the drone detection working directory to the new general working directory.
- Improved ADS-B alerts.
    - Updated the way the minimum vehicle speed configuration value is handled.
        - This value is now considered during alert processing, instead of when alerts are displayed. This improves efficiency, and means the minimum vehicle speed will be respected by external programs.
    - Re-organized the ADS-B alert configuration for sake of clarity.
    - The ADS-B message file is now cleared on start-up to prevent Assassin from needing to parse the entire file to remove old entries individually.
    - Fixed an issue that could cause Assassin to crash when parsing aircraft messages.
        - When an invalid ADS-B message was encountered, a fatal error would occur.
    - Aircraft threats are now sorted by highest to lowest threat level, then closest to furthest distance.
    - Moved the ADS-B message pruning process to a separate thread.
        - This changed effectively increases ADS-B alert processing speed on multi-threaded CPUs by over 2500%.
- Assassin can now be configured to display "status messages", which fall between the normal output and the debugging output, in terms of verbosity.
- Added `--headless` command line argument for external interfaces to disable user interaction elements of the console output.
- File-saving debug messages are now only displayed when the "silence" flag is set to `false`.
- Added support for multiple speed sources.
    - The GPS hardware provides a speed in each response. This is the only method Assassin supported previously.
    - The vehicle speed can be calculated by determining the distance between the last two GPS points, then dividing by the time difference.
    - The speed can be read directly from the car using an ELM327 adapter connected to the car's OBD-II port.
- Added process timing for helping users experienced improve speed.
- Fixed an issue in the `bearing_difference` function, where bearings were improperly reduced to a value below 360.
- Refined traffic enforcement camera alerts.
    - Updated the traffic enforcement camera database.
    - Re-organized the configuration.
    - Added filters to reduce unwanted alerts.
        - Cameras that are not in front of the car (with a customizable angle threshold) can be filtered.
        - Cameras that are not facing the direction the car is traveling (with a customizable angle threshold) can be filtered.
        - Cameras for which the speed limit has not been exceeded (with a customizable speed limit offset) can be filtered.
- The debug message printed when alerts are displayed in the console are now only displayed when there is an alert to display for a given category.
- Improved ALPR alerts.
    - Moved the false alert filtering configuration values to a dedicated section for sake of organization.
    - Added alert de-duplication, where cameras that are close to each other can be condensed into a single alert.
- Improved the intial GPS location fetching process.
- Assassin now erases the `alert.json` file in the interface directory in start-up to prevent external interfaces from displaying alerts from the last time Assassin was run.
- Updated status light interfacing.
    - Re-organized the status lighting configuration.
    - All alert types now have a corresponding status light color.
    - Status light changes now trigger a brief delay to allow all alerts to be shown.
    - System warnings and errors now have corresponding status lighting actions.
- Completely re-designed the Bluetooth monitoring system.
    - This feature worked unreliably, and was prone to causing unexpected behavior that could prevent other alerts from being processed correctly.
