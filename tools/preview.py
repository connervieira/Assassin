# Assassin - Database Preview

# This tool allows you to preview a point-of-interest database by plotting it's points on a graph. To use it, run it using Python3, then enter the following information as prompted.

# Type - This is the type of database. The traffic enforcement camera database uses the 'excam' format. The ALPR database, and other custom databases use the 'json' format.
# Database - This is an absolute file path to the database you want to preview.
# Longitude - This is the longitude of the center point of the graph.
# Latitude - This is the latitude of the center point of the graph.
# Radius - This is the radius you want to preview.
